# common mathematical operators in Python syntax.

# summation = a + b  # Addition
# difference = a - b # Subtraction
# product = a * b    # Multiplication
# quotient = a / b   # Division

# Parentheses can be used to order math operations.
# avg = (a + b + c) / 3

# Negative numbers in Python work the way you probably expect. Just add a minus sign:
# my_negative_num = -1
player_health = 100
poison_damage = -10

player_poison_health = player_health + poison_damage

print(player_poison_health)

# example of Multiplication
player_health = 1000
armor_multiplier = 2

armored_health  = player_health * armor_multiplier
print(armored_health)


# Multi-Line Comments (Aka docstrings)

# You can use triple quotes to start and end multi-line comments as well:

"""
    the code found below
    will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
"""
print("Hello, World!")

# This is useful if you don't want to add the # to the start of each line when writing paragraphs of comments.
